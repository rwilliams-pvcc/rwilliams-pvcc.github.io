</tr>
<tr>
    <td>operating system</td>
    <td>The software that controls the overall operation of the computer
        including file management, the user interface, and the program
        execution environment.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>job queue</td>
    <td>Organized on a list, jobs are in queue waiting to be processed in a first-in, first-out fashion. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>FIFO</td>
    <td>FIFO stands for first-in, first-out. See job queue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>interactive processing</td>
    <td>Development that allows a program that is being executed to carry on a dialogue
        through remote terminals.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>time-sharing multiprocessing</td>
    <td>Implemented a job queue to provide service for multiple users at what seems like
        the same time, but dividing the execution of the job in intervals.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>application software</td>
    <td>Consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>system software</td>
    <td>Performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. Provides the
        infrastructure that the application software requires.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>utility software</td>
    <td>Consists of software units that extend the capabilities of the operating system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>graphical user interface (GUI)</td>
    <td>Modern systems use this so objects can be manipulated, such as files and programs, and
        are represented pictorially on the display as icons.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>shell</td>
    <td>An old user interface that communicated with users through textual messages using a
        keyboard and monitor screen.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>kernel</td>
    <td>The internal part of an operating system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>device driver</td>
    <td>Software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with 
        peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>file manager</td>
    <td>Software unit whose job is to coordinate the use of the machine's mass storage facilities.
        Maintains records of all the files store in mass storage, including where each file is located, which
        users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available
        for new files or extensions to existing files.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>memory manager</td>
    <td>Charged with the task of coordinating the machine's use of main memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>virtual memory</td>
    <td>Large "fictional" memory space created by paging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>boot strapping</td>
    <td>A procedure that takes place every time a computer is turned on. It transfers the operating system 
        from mass storage into main memory.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ROM</td>
    <td>A type of computer storage that contains non-volatile, permanent data that can only be read, not altered.
        Stands for "read-only memory."
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>deadlock</td>
    <td>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for 
        a resource  that is allocated to another.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>spooling</td>
    <td>The technique of holding data for output at a later but more convenient time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>super user (or administrator)</td>
    <td>Highly privileged access to the operating system. Administrator can alter settings within the operating
        system, modify critical software packages, adjust the privileges granted to other users, and perform a
        variety of other maintenance activities that are denied normal users.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>multi-factor authentication</td>
    <td>An authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors
        to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or VPN. A growing number
